            <p>
                Hello, my name is Daniel! I am an undergraduate student at UC Santa Cruz and a research
                assistant
                at the Game User Interaction and Intelligence Lab. I will be graduating in
                June 2024
                with a Bachelor's degree in Art & Design: Games and Playable Media.
            </p>

            <p>
                Before I was a college student, I served in the US Army for 4 years as a combat medic and paratrooper.
                As a student veteran, I know firsthand the struggles that veterans face while navigating the educational
                system.
                During my time at UCSC, I have worked towards creating a meaningful community for veterans and
                military-connected students to help them achieve their academic goals and shatter negative
                stereotypes. I am also president of the UCSC Student Veteran Association.
            </p>

            <p>
                Games are my passion! Some of my most cherished memories involve video games, and they are undoubtedly a
                huge part of my life. I learned early on that games offer so much more than just entertainment.
                Thererfore, my goal is to be accepted into a graduate program where I can reseach the
                applications of games and interactive media, and that will ultimately prepare me to work in the gaming industry.

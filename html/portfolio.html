                <h3>Project Slime</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a small 2D RPG that I made for a 2 week game jam. This was my first time using
                    Godot, so it took me some time to get a running version of the game. I added a player and 
                    NPC's with sprite animations, a scene change, y-sorting, and dialogue. This
                    version of the game is only a prototype so far. 
                </p>

                <h3>La Lechuza</h3>
                <p>This is a Visual Novel that I worked on over a 2 week period for a class project. It adapts the story
                    of La Lechuza,
                    which is rooted in Mexican and Texano folklore. According to legend, La Lechuza was a witch who
                    made a deal with the devil and could transform into a giant owl. I designed the characters and
                    lead the coding part of the project.</p>

                <h3>Lotería: US Army Edition</h3>
                <p> Lotería is a traditional Mexican game similar to Bingo and is full of references to different
                    aspects of Mexican culture. When I was younger, I played using beans as markers. This was my way of
                    bringing together two significant parts of my life. This was a completely personal project and I
                    did all of the art myself in one afternoon.</p>

                <h3>Original Character</h3>
                <p>The first image is the fully-colored, digital sketch I did using Procreate on my iPad. The front and
                    side profiles are the references I used to create a 3D model in Blender. Next is the 3D model with 
                    seams and UV unwrap. And finally, the completed 3D model doing a run cycle. This entire project was 
                    the culminating assignment for a class done over a 10 week term.</p>

                <h3>TeamFight!</h3>
                <p>TeamFight! is a physical card game I made over a 5 week period for a final class project. I wanted
                    to replicate Dungeons and
                    Dragon's style of combat that you can play against your friends and without the need of a long
                    D&D campaign. The characters are based on common classes you might see in RPG fantasy games like
                    D&D, Dark Souls or Diablo.</p>

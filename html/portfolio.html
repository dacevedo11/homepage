                <h3>La Lechuza</h3>
                <p>This is a Visual Novel that I worked on over a 2 week period for a class project. It adapts the story
                    of La Lechuza,
                    which is rooted in Mexican and Texano folklore. According to legend, La Lechuza was a witch who
                    made a deal with the devil and could transform into a giant owl. I designed the characters and
                    lead the coding part of the project.</p>

                <h3>TeamFight!</h3>
                <p>TeamFight! is a physical card game I made over a 5 week period for a final class project. I wanted
                    to replicate Dungeons and
                    Dragon's style of combat that you can play against your friends and without the need of a long
                    D&D campaign. The characters are based on common classes you might see in RPG fantasy games like
                    D&D, Dark Souls or Diablo.</p>

                <h3>Strawberry Festival</h3>
                <p>The setting and characters are based on Stardew Valley, including what gifts the characters like.
                    I completed this project over a 2 week period for a class project using Inky. Ink is a narrative
                    scripting language, and I used variables, loops, and conditions to make the game more interactive
                    and less linear. I also used "callbacks" in the dialouge to make it feel like your choices matter.

                <h3>Lotería: US Army Edition</h3>
                <p> Lotería is a traditional Mexican game similar to Bingo and is full of references to different
                    aspects of Mexican culture. When I was younger, I played using beans as markers. This was my way of
                    bringing together two significant parts of my life. This was a completely personal project and I
                    did all of the art myself in one afternoon.</p>

                <h3>Original Character Concept</h3>
                <p>This is an orginal character I created. The inspiration for this character came from a few different
                    places, including Kill Bill, Yakuza, League of Legends, Bleach, and Chainsaw Man. The first image is
                    the fully-colored, digital sketch I did using Procreate on my iPad. The front and side profiles are
                    the references I used to create a 3D model in Blender. Next is the 3D model with seams and UV
                    unwrap. And finally, the completed 3D model doing a run cycle. This entire project was the
                    culminating
                    assignment for a class done over a 10 week term.</p>

                <h3>The Witch is Dead - Companion</h3>
                <p>The Witch is Dead is a one page RPG that I listened to from an episode of my favorite D&D podcast,
                    Dungeons and Daddies. I really liked the game and the idea behind it, so I thought I'd give it a try
                    for myself. Then I realized, I could probably build a companion tool/app to go along with it so I
                    could play with my friends over discord. I made the app over one weekend 
                    using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's pretty simple, but still I am pretty proud of it.</p>

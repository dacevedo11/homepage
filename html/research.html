            <p>I have come to realize that games and interactive media have so many more applications beyond
                entertainment. My diverse research interests lie in exploring the various roles these technologies can
                play in user experience, cultural and social change, and health.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have always been fascinated by narratives and the art of storytelling, with a specific interest
                in exploring diverse cultures through their folklore and mythology. I hope to explore the different
                ways in which narrative can create meaningful and interactive experiences. I believe narrative is a
                great way to explore and promote diverse cultural perspectives. While many games often take inspiration
                from Greek or Norse mythology, like <cite>God of War</cite> or <cite>Hades</cite>, I instead want to
                bring attention to underrepresented cultures that are commonly overlooked and challenge biases
                within mainstream media. For instance, there are many lesser known folktales from Latin America, like
                La Lechuza or El Silb√≥n, waiting to be explored and shared with a broader audience.
            </p>

            <p>
                My involvement in researching resilience as an undergraduate research assistant at the Game User
                Interaction and Intelligence Lab has sparked a personal interest in leveraging games to address
                mental health challenges, particularly PTSD among veterans. Given my own background as a disabled
                veteran, this is an area I am keen to explore. Inspired by previous studies exploring the therapeutic
                benefits of games for dealing with conditions like PTSD, I aspire to contribute to this field of
                research and pave the way for fellow veterans seeking opportunities within the gaming industry.
